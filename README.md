# art_application
This is my digital art-making tool using c++ and SFML. In this project I would like to create an intuitive art application where users can create paintings (and potentially pixel art images in the future) with ease. I want to create a user-friendly interface where users can easily navigate and create their pieces very efficiently. Users will be able to save and load files to continue working on them. As of now I have a very basic painting tool implemented but there is still a lot of work to do. I also have ambitions to create an AI art assistant extension for this using python. That is still in the air at the moment.
